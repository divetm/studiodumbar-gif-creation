# studiodumbar-gif-creation

Small design project for my friend Ray (it's Corona Time!).

You will need to install Python on your computer.

Then install the library Pillow (7.0.0 or above) - in a Terminal window run:
```
pip install Pillow
```

If you have dowloaded this project as a zip in your ```Downloads``` folder, unzip it and then in a Terminal window run:
```
cd Downloads/studiodumbar-gif-creation-master
python gif_generator.py
```
